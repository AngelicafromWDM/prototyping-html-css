<h2>Thanks for the great step-by-step video!</h2>
<strong>bolded text</strong>.
<em>emphasized text</em>.
**I'm pretty sure this makes text bold too?**
_and this makes this italized?_

1. Add your own MarkDown (.md) file with your lastname as the filename.
   - Mine would be named 'lindgren.md'.
2. Markup some simple content with some simple HTML. (HTML also works in markdown files.)
   - This is <strong>bolded text</strong>.
   - This is <em>emphasized text</em>.
3. Save it.
4. Conduct a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).
