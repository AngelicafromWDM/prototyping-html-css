      <h2>Web Fonts</h2>

      <p>This paragraph is using a web font (<code>.woff</code>) call <em>PT Sans</em>. It’s a
      little more refined and lends some <strong>unique character</strong> to
      the web page.</p>

      <h2>System Fonts</h2>

      <p>This paragraph is using a built-in sans-serif font. It could be Arial or Helvetica, etc, depending upon the user agent stylesheet. It’s not exactly ugly, but it’s definitely familiar.</p>

    <section id='indentation' class='section section--gray system-fonts paragraph-indent'>
      <h2>Paragraph Indentation</h2>

      <p>This paragraph is the first descendant of its parent container of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, so the CSS styles under the class name <code>.paragraph-indent p:first-of-type</code> will overwrite the styles under the class name <code>.paragraph-indent p</code>.</p>

      <p>However, this paragraph is after the first paragraph element and a descendant of its parent container of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. Consequently, the CSS styles under the class name <code>.paragraph-indent p</code> will apply.</p>

    <section id='spacing' class='section section--gray system-fonts paragraph-indent'>
      <h2>Spacing</h2>

      <p>James notes how good designers understand the benefits of white-space. In the figure below, he contrasts a good use of white space (left) with a messier version with tighter space (right).</p>

      <figure>
        <img src='images/white-space.png' alt='An example from James, which contrasts good use of white space with an unecessarily tight scheme.' />
      </figure>

      <p>James mentions how readers subconsciously find patterns with consistent spacing techniques. Accordingly, he asks you to pay close "attention to your <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, and <code>line-height</code> properties."</p>

        <h2>Manageable Line Length</h2>

        <p>You should try to limit the length of your lines to approximately 80 characters or less. It reduces strain on the reader’s eyes, since they don’t need to move back and forth as much. It also helps prevent them from jumping to the wrong line when they get to the end of the previous line. The end result is that it’s easier for visitors to digest your content.</p>

        <h2>Not-So-Manageable Line Length</h2>

        <p>This section contains the same text as the previous one, but with a line length that always stretches to the size of the browser. It’s more difficult to read when your browser window is wide.</p>
